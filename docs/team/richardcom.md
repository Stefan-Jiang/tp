## Project: IntelliBrary

IntelliBrary is a desktop library management application used for library administrators to manage books. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add books into the library.
  * What it does: allows the user to add new books into the library.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make changes to the booklist in the library.


* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `add` and `delete`
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `add` and `delete`
    * Added documentation about Non-functional requirements of the project.
